This source-code enables developers to use our algorithms for measuring uncertainty quantification in machine learning models. 
This code was used in our work that was published here: [Decision Theoretic Bootstrapping](https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/52034eb04b657aea,20894a8061d92d69,1af5a8c41033669e.html)

This project was a huge effort. It wouldn't have been possible without all the paper authors.
